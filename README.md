## Overview

**SciCore-Omics** is a gene-aware multimodal foundation model for joint reasoning over **histology images**, **spatial transcriptomic profiles**, and **biological language**.

Built on a MiniCPM-V-style multimodal language-model stack, SciCore-Omics introduces a dedicated transcriptomic branch that encodes gene-expression profiles with **NicheFormer**, compresses gene representations through a **Gene Q-Former**, and projects them into the language-model token space through a **Gene Projector**.

The model is designed for spatial biology and pathology scenarios where tissue morphology and molecular states should be interpreted together rather than treated as isolated modalities.

## Highlights

* **Tri-modal foundation model for spatial biology**
  SciCore-Omics links histology images, spatial transcriptomics, and biological language in a unified autoregressive modeling framework.

* **Dedicated gene branch**
  The model uses NicheFormer, a Gene Q-Former, and a Gene Projector to transform transcriptomic profiles into LLM-compatible embeddings.

* **Image-gene-text reasoning**
  SciCore-Omics supports image-only, gene-only, and image-gene joint inputs, enabling morphology-aware and molecule-aware biological reasoning.

* **Staged training pipeline**
  The repository provides separate training stages for gene-bridge distillation, Swift-based CPT/SFT, and GSPO/PPO-style reinforcement learning refinement.

* **Public release**
  Model weights, online demo, local inference code, and training entrypoints are publicly available.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Try the Online Demo

The fastest way to try SciCore-Omics is through the Hugging Face Space:

👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alkaidxxy/SciCore-Omics

The demo supports scientific questions with uploaded gene-expression files and/or histology images.

---

### Option 2: Run Local Inference

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/Scicore-Omics.git
cd Scicore-Omics
```

#### 2. Create the environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate OMICS
```

The reference environment was developed on Linux with NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB GPUs.

`flash-attn` can be sensitive to CUDA, PyTorch, and GPU versions. If installation fails, please adjust the `flash-attn` version according to your local environment.

#### 3. Download the model weights

You can download the public weights from Hugging Face:

```bash
huggingface-cli download openbmb/SciCore-Omics \
  --local-dir ./weights/SciCore-Omics
```

Alternatively, you can directly load the model by setting:

```text
model_path = "openbmb/SciCore-Omics"
```

#### 4. Run a minimal example

```bash
python eval/example.py \
  --model_path ./weights/SciCore-Omics \
  --image_path examples/assets/example.png \
  --gene_path examples/assets/example.h5ad \
  --prompt "Please describe the tissue morphology and molecular state of this sample."
```

Expected output:

```text
The model generates a natural-language response describing tissue morphology,
transcriptomic context, and potentially relevant biological processes.
```

---

## Before You Run

Please make sure you have:

* a CUDA-enabled GPU environment;
* the SciCore-Omics model weights from Hugging Face;
* a histology image in `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` format;
* a spatial transcriptomics file in `.h5ad` format;
* gene names compatible with the gene tokenizer resources under `model/gene_tokenizer/`.

---

## Examples

### Image + Gene Input

```bash
python eval/example.py \
  --model_path openbmb/SciCore-Omics \
  --image_path examples/assets/example.png \
  --gene_path examples/assets/example.h5ad \
  --prompt "Analyze this histology image together with its spatial transcriptomic profile."
```

### Gene-only Prompt

```bash
python eval/example.py \
  --model_path openbmb/SciCore-Omics \
  --gene_path examples/assets/example.h5ad \
  --prompt "Describe the biological state represented by this transcriptomic profile."
```

### Image-only Prompt

```bash
python eval/example.py \
  --model_path openbmb/SciCore-Omics \
  --image_path examples/assets/example.png \
  --prompt "Describe the tissue morphology in this histology image."
```

> The current `eval/example.py` may need to be adapted depending on your local input format. See [Input Format](#input-format) for details.

---

## Input Format

### Histology Image

Supported formats:

```text
.png
.jpg
.jpeg
```

Recommended preprocessing:

* use RGB images;
* avoid extremely large raw whole-slide images for minimal examples;
* crop or tile whole-slide images before inference when needed.

### Gene Expression File

The model expects spatial transcriptomic input in `.h5ad` format.

A typical `.h5ad` file should contain:

```text
adata.X          # gene-expression matrix
adata.var_names  # gene names
adata.obs        # spot/cell metadata, optional
adata.obsm       # spatial coordinates, optional
```

Minimal expected structure:

```python
import anndata as ad

adata = ad.read_h5ad("example.h5ad")
print(adata.X.shape)
print(adata.var_names[:10])
```

The gene names should be compatible with the tokenizer vocabulary and reference resources under:

```text
model/gene_tokenizer/
```

## Training Pipeline

SciCore-Omics uses a staged training strategy instead of a single monolithic training script.

The released training code is organized into three main parts:

```text
train-distill-gene/      # gene bridge distillation
train-swift-cpt-sft/     # Swift-based CPT/SFT
train-rl/                # GSPO/PPO-style RL refinement
```

### Stage 1: Gene Bridge Distillation

The `train-distill-gene/` directory isolates training for the gene-branch alignment modules:

* `gene_qformer`
* `gene_projector`
* optionally `gene_cls_head` in extended settings

This stage is useful when the main multimodal model already exists but the transcriptomic branch needs better alignment with the language-model representation space.

Main scripts:

| Script                                                           | Purpose                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `train-distill-gene/train_gene_bridge_distill.py`                | Single-GPU gene-bridge distillation.                                           |
| `train-distill-gene/train_gene_bridge_distill_ddp.py`            | Distributed distillation with cross-rank negatives.                            |
| `train-distill-gene/train_gene_bridge_distill_real_processor.py` | Preferred training path using the real processor and reference-gene alignment. |
| `train-distill-gene/inject_gene_bridge_weights.py`               | Injects trained gene-bridge weights into a full model directory.               |

### Stage 2: CPT/SFT with Swift

The `train-swift-cpt-sft/` directory contains Swift-based CPT/SFT entrypoints for the gene-aware MiniCPM-V model.

These scripts use `ms-swift` through commands such as:

```bash
swift pt
swift sft
```

The gene-specific logic is injected through Swift's custom registration mechanism rather than by modifying the Swift framework itself.

The custom registration file is:

```text
train-swift-cpt-sft/register/my_register_qformer.py
```

This register file defines the gene-aware MiniCPM-V model and template path. It handles `.h5ad` gene inputs, tokenizes gene names, builds `gene_input_ids`, `gene_attention_mask`, and `gene_bound`, expands the gene placeholder into the Gene Q-Former span, and exposes the resulting fields to the model batch.

Main files:

| File / Folder                                         | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train-swift-cpt-sft/register/my_register_qformer.py` | Swift custom register file for gene-aware MiniCPM-V + Gene Q-Former. |
| `train-swift-cpt-sft/script/cpt-example.sh`           | Example continued pretraining launcher.                              |
| `train-swift-cpt-sft/script/sft-example.sh`           | Example supervised fine-tuning launcher.                             |

Before running the training scripts, please replace placeholder paths such as:

```text
YOUR_SOURCE_PATH
YOUR_CONDA_ENV
BASE_MODEL
DATA_DIR
OUTPUT_PATH
LOG_PATH
GENE_VOCAB_PATH
```

### Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning Refinement

The `train-rl/` directory contains a GSPO/PPO-style reinforcement learning pipeline for score-guided multimodal optimization.

It separates rollout generation, reference-model scoring, and distributed actor updates.

Main components:

| File                        | Purpose                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train-rl/gen_worker.py`    | Samples examples, builds candidate batches, computes old-policy log probabilities, and prepares rollout data. |
| `train-rl/ref_server.py`    | Runs a Flask reference server and computes reference-model token log probabilities.                           |
| `train-rl/finetune_gspo.py` | Runs the DDP training loop with a clipped GSPO/PPO-style objective and KL penalty.                            |

The RL script freezes the full model by default and selectively trains the gene bridge, image resampler, and final LLM layers depending on the modality composition of the current rollout.
